## floppy dashboard

---

### What the heck is this?

That's a valid question! Floppy Dashboard is my homemade dashboard solution based on Python (curses), a floppy drive (or any removable media), and a raspberry pi zero W 1.1.

It's ultimately a glorified tmux meta-script handler, with YAML files stored on floppy discs acting as the "script", and this Python wrapper acting as the interpreter.
